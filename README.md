### What I learned

The layout for the page is build using flexbox. I learned about building a circle using css. Used SVG for Icons in page. I mentioned colors using hsla which provides opacity to the background color. There is an active state, when you hover the button its color changes to dark blue gradient. I learned about laying over the content on circle container using relative and absolute position values.
Background for the overall score container is mentioned using linear gradient.
